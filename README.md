Let's quickly learn how to use Dwitter.

## Signup

When you first run the program, you will see the login/signup page.
Simply check the "Create a new account?" box and it will show you the signup form.
The "Profile Image URL" section is optional. This will become your profile photo!
Don't worry, your credientials are encrypted with bcrypt encoding and we use HTTPS to securely send your password to the server üòÜ

## Post Dweets!

Try saying hi to them by simply filling in the text box at the top and clicking "Post" button (Or you can hit enter!)

## Delete and Update Tweet

By the way, you can only delete the posts you made with the account you are currently logged in. üëç

## See My Dweets

Is the main page overloaded with too many posts? You can view all the tweets you made by clicking "My Tweet" link in the header.
